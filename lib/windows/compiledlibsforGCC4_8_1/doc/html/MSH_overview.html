<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Overview of a MidiShare application</H1>

<P>This section gives an overview of MidiShare functions as used by a
typical application.</P>

<P><HR WIDTH="30%" align=CENTER></P>

<H2><A NAME="overview1"></A>1-Opening and Closing a MidiShare session
</H2>

<P>First of all, an application must make sure that MidiShare is
installed in memory, this check can be completed by the MidiShare
function.</P>

<P>Then the function MidiOpen should be called to start a MidiShare
session. This allows MidiShare to record information relative to the
application context (i.e. its name, the value of A5 register, etc.)
and to create a reception FIFO and to attribute a unique reference
number to the application.</P>

<P>Before closing, an application must call the counterpart MidiClose
function , giving its application reference number as an argument.
MidiShare can thus be aware of the precise number of active MidiShare
applications. In theory, there is no objection to an application
performing several MidiOpen's, under the condition that it performs
as many corresponding MidiClose's. In total, there must not be more
than 63 simultaneously open MidiShare applications .</P>

<P>As long as no MidiOpen's are performed, MidiShare is dormant and
has no affect on the operation of the computer. Following the first
MidiOpen, MidiShare becomes active, it then creates a task which will
be called by interrupt every millisecond, and initiates ACIA
interruption vectors and registers corresponding to the Midi ports.
MidiShare returns to its dormant state after the last MidiClose is
performed.</P>

<P><HR WIDTH="30%" align=CENTER></P>

<H2><A NAME="overview2"></A>2-Communications and Connections</H2>

<P>For an application to be able to transmit and receive events, it
must first be connected to one or more sources and destinations.</P>

<P>MidiShare is built around an internal communication mechanism
which allows the exchange of events in real-time between client
applications. An application can be thought of as a black box,
receiving a flow of events at input and producing a flow of events at
output. These 'black boxes' can be freely connected to others, thus
forming an arbitrary complex network. This is one of the major
advantages of MidiShare, that it allows transparent, powerful
collaboration between applications otherwise totally independent.
</P>

<P>MIDI hardware ins and outs are performed by a pseudo-application,
which is always refereed to as application number 0 and named
'MidiShare'. To communicate with the 'outside world', your
applications input and/or output should be connected to this
application.</P>

<P>The implementation of these connections is very simple. The
MidiConnect function allows the switching on or off connections
between a source and destination applications and the MidiIsConnected
function gives the state (on or off) of a connection. There is no
restriction to the establishing of connections, an application can be
source or destination of as many applications as you wish and of
course looping is possible.</P>

<P>In some special cases, it is important that an application can
obtain information regarding the other active MidiShare applications.
The MidiCountAppls function returns the number of open MidiShare
applications. The MidiGetIndAppl function returns the reference
number of an application by giving an order number (between 1 and the
result of MidiCountAppls). It is also possible to find the reference
number of an application by name using the MidiGetNamedAppl function.
In the same way, knowing an application reference number, it is
possible to find its name using the MidiGetName function. And last,
the MidiSetName function allows change of an applications name.</P>

<P>To write 'meta-applications' for the management of connections,
requiring information on context modifications in MidiShare (opening
of new applications, changing connections, etc.) , all that is
required is the definition of a context alarm using the
MidiSetApplAlarm and MidiGetApplAlarm functions. This alarm function
will be automatically called by MidiShare to inform the application
of all the occurred context changes.</P>

<P><HR WIDTH="30%" align=CENTER></P>

<H2><A NAME="overview3"></A>3-Sending and receiving</H2>

<P>Once connections have been established, an application can send
and receive MIDI events. Each application owns a reception FIFO in
which MidiShare puts a copy of received events. These events may come
from other applications or from the different Midi ports in active
use. MidiShare can in theory handle up to 256 ports. The
implementation of Midi ports is controlled by the MidiSetPortState
and MidiGetPortState routines, these functions must be used with
caution since they affect all applications.</P>

<P>The MidiCountEvs function allows an application at any time to
know the number of events waiting in its reception FIFO. This number
of events is only limited by the amount of memory available to
MidiShare. The available events are picked up by repeated calls to
the MidiGetEv function. The MidiAvailEv function is similar, except
it allows the reading of a received event while leaving it in the
FIFO. The MidiFlushEvs function eliminates all the events on wait in
the reception FIFO.</P>

<P>Events received by applications are duplicates, the application
can therefore freely dispose of them without any repercussion on
other applications. However, an application must not forget to free
them when it no longer needs them.</P>

<P>Each application can select the events it receives by using a
filter. The filtering process is local to the application and has no
influence on the events received by the other applications. The
implementation of these filters is achieved by two routines :
MidiSetFilter and MidiGetFilter.</P>

<P>MidiShare drives an internal absolute clock of 32 bits which is
automatically switched on with the first MidiOpen and keeps running
until the last MidiClose. This clock is used to date (in
milliseconds) all the received events, as well as to specify the
sending dates of events to be transmitted. Moreover, it provides all
the applications with an absolute time reference. Its value can be
read by the MidiGetTime function.</P>

<P>Three functions facilitate the transmission of events. The
MidiSendIm function allows the immediate transmission of an event and
the MidiSend and MidiSendAt functions allow time delayed
transmission, MidiShare automatically managing the scheduling of the
transmission time.</P>

<P>(thanks to this mechanism, applications can plan transmission of
millisecond accuracy up to many days in advance.)</P>

<P>Once an event is transmitted (by the means of MidiSend, MidiSendAt
or MidiSendIm), it is no longer accessible by the application. This
event must no longer be refereed to, as to do so would cause
irreparable damage to MidiShare's event organization.</P>

<P><HR WIDTH="30%" align=CENTER></P>

<H2><A NAME="overview4"></A>4-Event managing</H2>

<P>The memory management of a standard application is generally
performed by the computers 'Memory Manager' (MM). The MM deals with
dynamic allocation, freeing memory blocks of arbitrary length, and
memory compacting when necessary (in the case of excessive
fragmentation of memory). A traditional MM is unsuitable for use in a
real time context for the following reasons:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Only large memory blocks can be allocated efficiently. For
   example, the Macintosh MM has an overhead of several bytes per
   allocated blocks, which is prohibitive for the very small groups
   of bytes associated with Midi events.
   
   <LI>The allocation time of a block is not constant, but depends on
   several factors, one of which being the fragmentation state of the
   memory. Allocation times can be very long if memory needs to be
   compacted and therefore a traditional MM cannot guarantee a
   response time.
   
   <LI>A traditional MM is not re-entrant, therefore no routine under
   interruption can use it either directly or indirectly, without
   disorganizing the memory space.
</UL>

<P>To overcome these short-comings, MidiShare possess its own memory
manager, which is adapted to the Midi event management and available
under interruption.</P>

<P>MidiShare drives a group of events common to all the applications.
Each event has compulsory fields (date, channel, port, type, etc.)
and variable fields that depend of its type.</P>

<P>Allocation is performed by the MidiNewEv function which returns an
event of a suitable type. The counterpart de-allocation is done by
the MidiFreeEv function. Another way of allocating an event is to
duplicate an existing event by the MidiCopyEv function.</P>

<P>It is possible at any time to discover the available remaining
event space, by the MidiFreeSpace function.</P>

<P>Access to the common event fields can be done directly, but access
to the variable fields is achieved through the MidiSetField and
MidiGetField functions.</P>

<P>Some categories of events do not have a fixed number of fields,
for example Exclusive System messages, in this case the
MidiCountFields function returns the number of fields in the variable
length event and the MidiAddField function allows the addition of a
field at the tail of the variable length event.</P>

<P>For some special applications, it may be necessary to access the
basic functions of the memory manager. All the events managed by
MidiShare are implemented in fixed-size cells (16 bytes). Most events
need just one cell, others like the System Exclusive use a variable
number of linked cells. Most applications normally does not have to
worry about storage 'details', nevertheless, two functions are
provided for low level memory management. The first one, MidiNewCell,
allows to allocate a simple cell. The second one, MidiFreeCell,
operates in reverse and de-allocates a cell.</P>

<P><HR WIDTH="30%" align=CENTER></P>

<H2><A NAME="overview5"></A>5-Sequence managing</H2>

<P>MidiShare provides basic functionalities for the managing of
sequences of time ordered events. The MidiNewSeq function allocates a
new sequence, empty at the start and the MidiAddSeq function inserts
an event into the sequence, maintaining the time order.</P>

<P>The MidiApplySeq function is an iterating function which allows
the processing of a sequences events, by a user defined function, the
address of which is passed as a parameter.</P>

<P>The MidiClearSeq function flushes the contents of a sequence and
the MidiFreeSeq function frees the sequence events.</P>

<P><HR WIDTH="30%" align=CENTER></P>

<H2><A NAME="overview6"></A>6-Real time tasks</H2>

<P>The MidiShare scheduling mechanism is based around the concept of
alarms. An alarm is a function whose address is sent to MidiShare by
an application, MidiShare will then call this function in real time
to indicate the occurrence of an event, even if the application is in
interrupt.</P>

<P>Each application can define two categories of alarms, the first is
defined by the MidiSetApplAlarm function, this warns of any change in
the global context of MidiShare (see paragraph "Communications and
connections"). The second category is defined by the MidiSetRcvAlarm
function which informs of the presence of new events in the reception
FIFO. This alarm is always called under interruption, and therefore,
it must not use the Macintosh Memory Manager either directly or
indirectly. However, it can have a free access to all the MidiShare
functions (apart from MidiOpen or MidiClose) and it may also access
the global variables of the application, as before the call,
MidiShare restores its context register.</P>

<P>Macintosh desk accessories cannot have global variables, so to
make up for this drawback the MidiSetInfo routine allows each
application to define a data area. The area pointer remains
accessible by the MidiGetInfo function, even during alarms, and it
can also be used for global data areas for desk accessories and other
application.</P>

<P>Once the RcvAlarm is set, the application can organise its
real-time tasks utilizing its private FIFO. As opposed to traditional
Midi events, private events are messages that an application sends to
itself, an application generally makes use of these to remember a
task to be done at a precise date.</P>

<P>When the date of a private event falls, MidiShare puts the event
into the applications reception FIFO, where it waits to be picked up
and handled in the same way as MIDI events.</P>

<P>MidiShare implements a second mechanism to manage tasks. This is a
time-delayed function call using MidiTask (or MidiCall) and the
MidiDTask procedures. To achieve this call, MidiShare collects the
call arguments, as well as the functions address to be called and
triggers a special event (typeProcess or typeDProcess). When a
typeProcess event falls MidiShare restores the application context
and proceeds to the call the function. However, when a typeDProcess
event falls, the function is not processed immediately, but placed in
a waiting list belonging to the application.</P>

<P>The MidiCountDTasks allows an application to find the number of
tasks currently waiting to be executed, they can then be executed
when required using MidiExec1DTask which executes the next task on
wait. (Note that actual execution must be initiated by the
application )</P>

<P>As the MidiTasks are processed under interruption, they must not
call directly or indirectly the operating system. The MidiDTasks
allow a by-pass of this obstacle since the application triggers their
processing (generally in the main loop).</P>

<P>Under certain circumstances, 'forgetting' an already launched but
not yet processed MidiTask or MidiDTask, can be useful. The
MidiForgetTask function is used for this purpose. Also an
applications MidiDTask waiting list can be deleted by MidiFlushDTasks
function.</P>

<P>In order to simplify communication between application tasks and
to the manage sharing of variables, two non-interruptable,
pointer-handling routines are provided. The MidiReadSync function
reads and sets to NIL the value at a memory address, and the
MidiWriteSync function updates the value of an address only if its
current value is NIL.</P>

<P><HR WIDTH="30%" align=CENTER></P>

<H2><A NAME="overview7"></A>7-Midi Time Code Synchronisation</H2>

<P>MidiShare can be synchronised to an external Midi Time Code (MTC)
using the MidiSetSyncMode function. MidiSetSyncMode takes a parameter
describing the chosen synchronisation mode (internal or external) and
the synchronisation input port to be used. The synchronisation mode
is global and it affects all MidiShare applications. The function
MidiGetSyncInfo provides information regarding the synchronisation
process.</P>

<P>When the synchronisation mode is set to internal (the default
mode), MidiShare is driven by an internal interrupt every
millisecond. (the "size" of a MidiShare time unit is one millisecond)
The function MidiGetTime gives MidiShare's internal time, which is
the time elapsed since the very first MidiOpen, expressed in
milliseconds.</P>

<P>When the synchronisation mode is set to external, MidiShare looks
for an incoming MTC. When enough MTC's are detected, MidiShare
becomes locked to the signal. It warns all the Midi applications, by
calling their ApplAlarm, if any, with the code using MidiSyncStart. A
typical sequencer might use this information to start playing a
sequence according to the position of the tape. The function
MidiGetExtTime returns the position of the tape in milliseconds.</P>

<P>When an incoming MTC is no longer detected, MidiShare becomes
unlocked, it automatically adjust its time unit to one millisecond
and again informs the midi applications via their ApplAlarm with the
code MidiSyncStop. A typical sequencer application may for example
decide to stop playing its sequences in this situation.</P>

<P>While MidiShare is locked, it maintains a constant offset between
its internal time and the external time (the time of the tape), by
automatically adjusting the size of the time unit to follow the speed
variations of the incoming MTC. The size of the MidiShare time unit
will be exactly one millisecond when the MTC runs at its nominal
speed, it will increase when the MTC slows down and decrease when the
MTC's speed increases. For example with an MTC format of 25
frames/second, one frame represents 40 milliseconds (1000/25). In
this case MidiShare will adjust the size of its time unit in order to
always have 40 time units per frame whatever the actual speed of the
incoming MTC. Consequently, from the point of view of a Midi
application, the duration of one frame at 25 frames/seconds will
always be 40 milliseconds.</P>

<P>The function MidiGetExtTime returns the external time (the time of
the tape expressed in milliseconds).</P>

<P>While MidiShare is locked :</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><CODE><FONT SIZE=2>MidiGetTime() - MidiGetExtTime() ==
constant offset</FONT></CODE></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The difference between MidiShare's internal time and the tape time
expressed in millisecond is a constant. Two functions are provided to
convert between external and internal time MidiInt2ExtTime and
MidiExt2IntTime :</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><CODE><FONT SIZE=2>MidiInt2ExtTime( MidiGetTime() ) ==
MidiGetExtTime()</FONT></CODE></P>

<P><CODE><FONT SIZE=2>MidiExt2IntTime( MidiGetExtTime() ) ==
MidiGetTime()</FONT></CODE></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Two additional functions, MidiTime2Smpte and MidiSmpte2Time, are
provided to make conversions between time expressed in millisecond
and SMPTE time locations. For example :</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><CODE><FONT SIZE=2>MidiTime2Smpt ( MidiGetExtTime(),
3, &amp;loc )</FONT> </CODE></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This will set loc with the current SMPTE location of the tape
using SMPTE format 3 (30 frames / seconds).</P>

<P>These functions can be used to convert SMPTE locations from one
format to another. For example suppose we want to derive a SMPTE
location from a current 30 drop frame format, we can write :</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><CODE><FONT SIZE=2>MidiTime2Smpte( MidiSmpte2Time
(&amp;loc), 2, &amp;loc);</FONT></CODE></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>where 2 means 30 drop frame.</P>
