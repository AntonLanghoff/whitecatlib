===========================
Player Library for Linux
===========================

The Player library is provided to allow the development of a complete multi-tracks MidiShare sequencer. 
Each Player is a MidiShare application, has 256 tracks, four different synchronization mode,  
events chase and loop markers. A Player use MidiShare sequences. Functions are provided 
to read on write MIDIfiles and convert them to the MidiShare sequence format. 
	
=====================
Installation guide
=====================

The Player source package contains:

- src : the source code for all platforms.
- linux : linux specific files, interface for java


==========================================
Compilation of Player library
==========================================

You should have compiled MidiShare kernel and library before compiled the Player library.
Look at http://www.grame.fr/MidiShare/SCPP/SCPP.html for more informations.

In the linux folder:

make 

This compile the Player shared library (a libPlayer.1.0 file) 

To install the Player library, you must have SU privilege:

make install

==========================================
Compilation of Player library for JAVA
==========================================

You should have compiled MidiShare kernel and library before compiling the Player library.
Look at http://www.grame.fr/MidiShare/SCPP/SCPP.html for more informations.

You must have the Java JDK installed on your machine. Look at http://java.sun.com/ 
for more informations.

To compile the JNI interface, some Java JNI specific include files are needed. Edit the makefile 
and change the INC2 and INC3 pathnames to match your environnement.

In the linux folder:

make java

This compile the Player shared library for JAVA (a libJPlayer.so file). This library contains all
Player code and the JNI interface for the JVM.

===============
Installation 
===============

To install the Player library for JAVA, you must copy the libJPlayer.so in your jdkxx/lib
folder. It's strongly recommended to use native threads vm in conjunction with JNI.

=================
Known problems
=================

- They are still synchronization problems in MidiShare and in the Player library that may crash applications
which use the Player library.

- The Player library has been successfully used with the SUN JRE 1.2.2 version for Linux used in native thread
mode. Use of other JVM implementation may work...or not.
