<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The MidiShare WAN Driver provides real-time
network communication to MidiShare client applications over the
Internet. Remote host connection is controlled by the user. Once
connected to a remote host, it will appear as a MidiShare port
when the application runs in driver mode, or as a MidiShare client
on the contrary (see <A HREF="../ReadMe.html#setupMenu">Setup
Menu</A>).<BR>
Connected hosts transmission state is available using the Remote
menu. <BR>
At connection time, the driver establish both a TCP and a UDP
socket between the local and the remote host.</FONT></P>

  <UL>
    <LI><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Arial">Offset to initial latency
    </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">: when stabilized, it represents the
    network latency variation. At connection startup, it will generally
    vary as the latency parameter is also used to compensate for
    the frequency difference between the sender and the receiver
    clocks. The driver includes a mechanism to compensate for these
    frequencies difference, this mechanism needs a certain time to
    operate with accuracy. During this time, the clock drifts are
    compensated using the maximum latency mechanism.</FONT>
    <LI><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Arial">Maximum latency over</FONT><FONT
     FACE="Arial">: represents the maximum network latency overruns.
    Any overrun represents a time rendering distortion of the transmitted
    events. You can avoid overruns by increasing the maximum latency
    parameter.</FONT>
    <LI><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Arial">Missing packets</FONT><FONT
     FACE="Arial">: represents the total number of missing packets
    for the current session. As the driver don't include any error
    recovery mechanism, the events corresponding to these packets
    are loosen. Correct transmission of an event, can be ensured
    using the TCP transmission.</FONT>
    <LI><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Arial">Throughput</FONT><FONT
     FACE="Arial">: represents for the input and output UDP streams,
    the size of the transmitted packets. When the indicator grows
    up to the red color, it means that the transmitted data don't
    fit in a single packet and are sent (or received) using several
    successive packets. This case should be avoided as it increases
    the probability of missing packets.</FONT>

<H3><FONT FACE="Arial">TCP transmission:</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The MidiShare port number 255 is reserved
  for secure transmission: every event received by ta network client
  on the port 255 will be transmitted using the TCP socket instead
  of the UDP socket. The mechanisms for the TCP transmission are
  the same than for UDP transmission. However, the TCP and UDP
  streams are not synchronized, therefore the TCP events time rendering
  may be incorrect relatively to the corresponding UDP events.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Secure transmission may be used to send
  important system exclusives at initialization time for example.
  Its drawback is that there is no guarantee on the transmission
  time.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Real-time transmission of the MidiShare
  events stream relies on 2 mechanisms :</FONT></P>
  <UL>
    <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">a grouping period : the period during
    which events are accumulated before being transmitted on the
    network. It is intended to optimize network transmissions. This
    parameter controls the transmission behavior.</FONT>
    <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">a maximum latency : represents the maximum
    transmission time (from sender to receiver) allowed to ensure
    a correct time rendering of the transmitted events. It is intended
    to compensate for the network latency and the transmission time
    variations. This parameter controls the receiver behavior.</FONT>
  </UL>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The total delay introduced by the network
  transmission is equal to the grouping period + the maximum transmission
  delay + the initial transmission delay. This parameter controls
  the transmission behavior.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">These parameters can be adjusted using
  the UDP Preferences form (see Setup Menu).</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The default values are 1500 milliseconds
  for the maximum latency and 200 milliseconds for the grouping
  time.</FONT> <BR>

  udp and tcp port number.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
