MidiShare Midi Time Piece Drivers 

There is one Driver for each Serial Port (Modem and Printer). Each Driver support two linked MTP interface (16 input port + 16 output port).

The best way to start is to run the driver and the MTP interface before sending or receiving any MIDI event. If you don't, you must ensure that both the driver and the interface are aware of the current input / output port.
You can force the driver to send the port change information using one of the following way : 
  - send an event on differents MTP ports
  - wait 1/2s without sending any events; it forces the driver to resend the current port number
You can reset the MTP interface to force the current port transmission, or transmit events from different ports.

When you launch the driver, be sure that the serial port is not busy. If it is, you will get an error message and the driver will quit (typically, the Printer port can't be allocated while AppleTalk is running). 

When the driver is running, the serial port is busy until MidiShare sleep time.

Depending on the MIDI flow level, errors may occur on the serial chip at reception time. In particular, sending and receiving a large system exclusive in the same time may result in receiving errors. This is due to 68k code emulation on native PowerPC stations.
