MidiShare Internet Drivers 

The MidiShare Internet Drivers provide real-time communication over Internet to MidiShare client applications. These drivers are two separate applications:

¥ msLAN : provides low latency real-time communication restricted to local array networks. It includes automatic recognition of remote hosts.

¥ msWAN : provides  real-time communication over Internet. Remote host connection is controlled by the user.
 
For both drivers, remote hosts appears as MidiShare ports or as MidiShare clients, depending on the driver running mode.

The application msLANDriver is identical to msLAN except that it's a background only application and it always runs in driver mode.

For more information, report to the MidiShare Internet Drivers documentation.
